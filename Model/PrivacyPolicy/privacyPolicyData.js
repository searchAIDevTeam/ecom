    text: "We will make sure that your personal information is protected when it is sent outside of the IKEA Group. We make sure our trusted service partners keep your personal information safe. When IKEA set out to create a high-quality, low-priced line of home furnishings, we knew we couldn't do it without the help of some very important partners-you, our customers. Whether you're researching purchases in the IKEA catalogue, picking up your furniture in our self-serve warehouses or assembling your purchases at home-we're working together to help you create a better everyday life at a price everyone can afford. IKEA is based on a partnership with our customers. Without you, IKEA could not exist. This partnership extends to the way we handle your personal information. Just like shopping at IKEA is a cooperative experience, IKEA makes a point of working with our customers when it comes to their privacy. We only collect the information we may need to create a better shopping experience for you. This Privacy Notice is our way of telling you what information we collect, how we use it and how you can access, change and remove your information. ",
