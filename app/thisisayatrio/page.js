                  Product safety is a top priority for AYATRIO. It’s integrated

                  safety day-in, day-out. At AYATRIO we believe that children are
                  the most important people in the world and the safety of our
                  products especially children’s products is of the highest
                  priority.

                  AYATRIO has 75 years’ experience in everyday life at home. For
                  years, AYATRIO has taken a proactive approach to develop
                  innovative solutions to further enhance product safety and
                  user-friendliness. For example, AYATRIO was one of the first
                  furniture companies to introduce cordless blinds and to phase
                  out harmful chemicals.

                  Unsustainable consumption is one of the world’s biggest global
                  challenges. We are committed to promoting sustainable
                  consumption, but we know we cannot achieve our ambitions
                  alone. Our approach involves taking the lead and joining
                  forces with others, including governments, through advocacy,
                  collaboration, and business partnerships.
                </p>

                  We are exploring circular business models that will enable us

                  commercially scalable and viable solutions will be.

                  The low price does not mean low-quality or unsustainable. Just
                  as high price does not mean high quality and sustainable. We
                  want to make the products in our range available to many
                  people. Keeping prices low is a cornerstone of our business
                  idea. But this must never come at the expense of people and
                  the environment.

                  At AYATRIO we believe in taking responsibility for ensuring that
                  the materials we source for our products are used in the most
                  efficient way. For wood we work to create more from less,
                  minimizing waste and using as much of the raw wood material as
                  possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At AYATRIO we have decided to work with the highest available
                  standards in the industry in terms of protecting responsible
                  forestry. We don’t allow any wood in our supply chain from
                  forest areas that are illegal or contains high conservation
                  values, or from forest areas with social conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being Forest Positive is also about going beyond our own
                  product material needs and promoting responsible forest
                  management for the benefit of people and the planet.
